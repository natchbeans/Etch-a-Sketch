# Etch-a-Sketch

I am going to describe the project from the Odin Project. 

Create a webpage with a 16x16 grid of square divs.

Create divs using JS not in the HTML file.

Put the grid squares inside a container, the container can be in the HTML file.

Use FlexBox to make the divs appear as a grid. It says try not to use CSS grid.

Set up "hover" effect so that the grid div changes color when your mouse passes over. 

Add button at top of the screen that will allow the user to pick the number of squares per side.Once entered the grid should be removed, and new grid should be generated.

You can Google things as well.
